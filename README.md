# Fuel-Planner - The Smart Refueling Assistant
Fuel-Planner is a smart refueling assistant that helps drivers plan their routes and find the best refueling options based on their vehicle's current mileage and fuel level. The app uses the Google Maps API to calculate routes, determine when a vehicle might need to refuel, and find nearby refueling stations that meet the driver's criteria.

## Features
- Calculates the total distance and duration of a route between two locations.
- Identifies potential break points along a route where a vehicle might need to refuel.
- Finds nearby refueling stations based on a query and minimum rating.
- Provides the distance and duration from the break point to all the nearby refueling stations.
